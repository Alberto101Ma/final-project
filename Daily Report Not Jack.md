# Researched Twitter's API
Looked into making a developer Twitter account, as well as creating an email for our project that we can create social media accounts under so we can access APIs.

Applied for twitter dev account
Researched more about twitter and reddit API
Plan to create a reddit account, with which we will use to send requests

Created a Twitter app, found a javascript library for twitter's API, and got access tokens and keys.  They are a random, long string of letters.  Who could have guessed that?

Kept working on editing the boiler plate of the library to custom fit our needs, but ran into a really annoying 404. Progress is slow but steady.

Not even riley could see what was wrong because of the lack of a debugger, making the library take way more time than it is worth.  Switched to a new library though!

# 5/1/19
Found a great new library, but need mocha to run it.  However, my computer is fighting me with permission to install it.  It is saying that I need to be an admin.  Well, Riley fixed that with sudo, but still working on running the test.
