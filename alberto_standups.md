 -  Did a lot of research as well as investigating to find a way to incorporate the API's from various sites (Twitter and Reddit) into our own project 
 - Riley also taught me how to do [THIS!](https://google.com)

 - Today was a very busy class day! I spent a good amount of time  continuing trying to figure out how to incorporate Reddit (specifically!) With luck, I came across [snoowrap](https://github.com/not-an-aardvark/snoowrap) which is a wrapper, able to access the Reddit site! I ran out of time for today, but I know I need to incorporate [oauth](https://github.com/not-an-aardvark/reddit-oauth-helper) for next class, to be able to create a fully functional Reddit site (hopefully)! A challenge I'm facing is researching a bunch of new terms that I have never heard of before, as well as incorporating these new terms into my project.
